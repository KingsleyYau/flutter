/// A `UIImage` category for scaling images.
@interface UIImage (TFLite)
  
  /// Creates and returns a new image scaled to the given size. The image preserves its original PNG
  /// or JPEG bitmap info.
  ///
  /// - Parameter size: The size to scale the image to.
  /// - Returns: The scaled image or `nil` if image could not be resized.
- (UIImage *)scaledImageWithSize:(CGSize)size;
  
  /// Returns the data representation of the image after scaling to the given `size` and removing
  /// the alpha component.
  ///
  /// - Parameters
  ///   - size: Size to scale the image to (i.e. image size used while training the model).
  ///   - byteCount: The expected byte count for the scaled image data calculated using the values
  ///       that the model was trained on: `imageWidth * imageHeight * componentsCount * batchSize`.
  ///   - isQuantized: Whether the model is quantized (i.e. fixed point values rather than floating
  ///       point values).
  /// - Returns: The scaled image as data or `nil` if the image could not be scaled.
- (NSData *)scaledDataWithSize:(CGSize)size
